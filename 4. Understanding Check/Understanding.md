# Understanding Check

Create a 2D array that stores the alphabet (and a space character ` `) one character at a time as `String` objects. Each row should have 3 values. The 2D array should look like this:

```
a   b   c
d   e   f
...
y   z    
```

The last `String` after the letter `z` is the space character ` `.

Use this 2D array to print the following by combining letters:

```
computer
java
i am typing
```

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
