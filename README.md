# AP Computer Science A - Unit 8 Section 2

# Traversing 2D Arrays

In this section we will discuss how we can traverse through the values stored in 2D arrays.

This section covers the following material:

- Traversing 1D Arrays
- Approaches to Traversing 2D Arrays
- Traversing 2D Arrays with `for` Loops
- Traversing 2D Arrays with `for-each` Loops
- Searching in a 2D Array
- 2D Array Algorithms
  - Minimum
  - Maximum
  - Sum
  - Average
  - An Element with a Property
  - All Elements with a Property
  - Determine the Number of Elements Meeting a Criteria
