# Initial Try

In the `Try.java` file, fix the work on the 2D array `nums`. There are comments on each line letting you know what should happen so you can determine what to change.

The code is trying to randomly assign integers to each element of the 2D array, and then later print out those values.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
