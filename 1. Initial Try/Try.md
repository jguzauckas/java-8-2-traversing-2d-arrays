# Initial Try

In the `Try.java` file, fix the work on the 2D array `strs`. There are comments on each line letting you know what should happen so you can determine what to change.

The output should look like this when completed:

```
i
z
aa
```

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
