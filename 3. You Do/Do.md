# You Do

Choose three musical artists. For each of those artists, choose 3 albums they have released (or are going to release).

In a 2D array, store the years that each album was released. In this 2D array, a row should represent a musical artist (all of their album years should be in the same row). This sould result in a 3x3 array.

Now, select one of the years to modify by adding 5.

Then, select another of the years to modify by subtracting 2.

Print out all of the years stored in the 2D array so that it looks like this:

```
Artist 1: ####    ####    ####
Artist 2: ####    ####    ####
Artist 3: ####    ####    ####
```

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
